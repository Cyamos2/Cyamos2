# 👋 Hi, I'm Christopher Amos

I'm a junior software engineer and cybersecurity-aware developer passionate about building secure, user-focused web applications.

🔧 I build full-stack apps using **JavaScript**, **Python**, **HTML/CSS**, and tools like **React**, **Node.js**, and **Git**.  
🧠 I have training from **BloomTech**, **Google**, and **Cisco**, and I'm preparing for the **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** certification.  
💻 My projects range from CLI tools and log parsers to responsive websites and UI prototypes.  
📈 I’m actively seeking junior dev roles where I can contribute, grow, and deliver clean, secure, and thoughtful code.
